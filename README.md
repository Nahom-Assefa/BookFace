# BookFace
A social media network where users can share their thoughts, react, and create a friends list.

**Version 1.0.0**

## The Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build and structure the API for a social network application. The premise was where users could share thoughts, create a friends list, and react to other users content. 

## Significant Changes
This project required us to utilize and apply the concepts we learned in module 18 specifically MongoDB and its document object mapper mongoose. Mongoose enabled us to add some structure to the generally unstructured nature of Mongo databases while also allowing us to avoid interacting with the mongo shell. Another concept applied in this challenge is the segmentation of routes from controllers which made it more readable and easier to visualize.

## Challenges
The challeneges on this assignment came from undoing bad sequel habits I had that lingered in my thinking. From a theoretical perspective it also took some time to wrap my head around what I would need to establish certain methods on the controller object and the subsequent route. For example, creating a reaction only requires a thoughtId, and a json body, but deleting a reaction requires a thoughtId, body, and a reactionId.
